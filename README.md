## getting started 

The team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 

City officials have questions about the program, so the first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 



## visualization outline 

1. **Usage Statistics:**
   
    - What is the total number of rides taken in each quarter?
    - What is the average duration of each ride?
    - What are the peak usage times (hours, days, months)?
    - How many unique users are there in each quarter?
    - What is the average number of rides per user?
1. **Geographical Trends:**
   
    - Which locations are the most popular starting and ending points for rides?
    - What are the most common routes taken?
    - Are there areas with high demand but low availability of bikes?
4. **Economic Impact:**
   
    - What is the revenue generated in each quarter?
    - What are the operating costs in each quarter?
    - What is the net economic impact on the city (considering factors like reduction in traffic congestion, improved air quality, etc.)?
